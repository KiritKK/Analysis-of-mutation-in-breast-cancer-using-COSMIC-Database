# Analysis-of-mutation-in-breast-cancer-using-COSMIC-Database

In this project, we aim to use the Cancer Browser, provided by COSMIC DB, as a source for links for genes which are most likely to be mutated. For this, we will be using the Selenium WebDrive in Python. After obtaining the links, we will show the genes in the form of a database which was made by us for easier access of genes.
